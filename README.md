# ♬ BEATLINE ♬

## Overview
Beatline is a minimalistic rhythm game built in Pygame! It used pygbag to convert to WASM to be played on the web. With this game, you can play a selection of 3 different songs (more to be added later) each with different difficulties. The game will give you a score based on how well you do!
Additionally, this comes with a working beatmap creator for songs! Although it doesn't work on the web version (pygame.mixer.music.get_pos() isn't supported) you can download the whole folder and run the main.exe file to run it locally and it will work. Additionally, check out the demo below.

## Background
I genuinely love rhythm games, there's something so fun about the tight syncronization between music and inputs. I'm starting to learn other languages such as Java after focusing on python and pygame for so long, so I think that this will be a good closing project in order to showcase all that I've learned.
I had a lot of fun making this and am pretty proud of the result. I'll definitely return again and polish some aspects of the game.
